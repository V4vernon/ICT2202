# Digital Forensic Assignment 1

# Task 
In this assignment, you and your team are required to design and develop a technical solution for a problem in digital forensics.
You are free to decide on what your solution does and the problem it addresses. It is expected that your solution be of a high quality, sufficient complexity, and novel.

# Guide
What is the problem you are focusing on?
Is that problem within the domain of digital forensics?
What is your proposed solution to solve the problem?
Is the proposed solution reasonably complex?
What are the existing solutions or tools out there that can be used to address the problem, and how would they compare against your proposed solution?
Does development of your proposed solution allow for demonstration of technical competency in digital forensics?
How much of knowledge that is required to develop the solution lies beyond the classroom?
Can the technical solution be developed to a reasonably high quality, tested in- depth and validated within eight weeks, by a four-person team?
Does the solution have potential to be showcased to the public, such as through community meetups or cybersecurity conferences?
